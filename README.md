## General Information
-    Implementation of a Multiple Linear Regression Machine Learning model to predict the demand of shared bikes in US
-    The business problem is to come up with predictive Analytics to infer demand of shared bikes in US so that revenue thread can be increased 




## Conclusions
-    Using Multiple Linear Regression techniques, we were able to identify the exact features that strongly influences the demand of the shared bikes so that the management of boom Bikes can understand how the demand vary with different features helping them build a business strategy to increase revenue/profits


## Technologies Used
-    Python 
-    Libraries: 
	pandas 
        sklearn
	statsmodels 
	matplotlib 
	seaborn
